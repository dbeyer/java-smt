#
# INFO:
# This script has to be used with the Yices2 and GMP installed as explained
# below in Windows with Cygwin!
#
# #########################################
# 
# Information as to how to compile Yices2 for Windows: https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2/blob/master/doc/COMPILING
# Information as to how to compile GMP for Windows for Yices2: https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2/blob/master/doc/GMP
# Note: Cygwin is needed for compiliation, but the binary can be build in a way that it is not needed for execution.
# 
# Install Cygwin https://www.cygwin.com/
# Note: choose to install "mingw64-x86_64-gcc-..." (at least core and g++), 
#   "mingw64-x86_64-headers", "mingw64-x86_64-runtime", "gcc-core", "gcc-g++",
#   "libgcc", "cmake", "bash", "m4" and "make", "automake", "autoconf2.1",
#   "autoconf2.5", "autoconf" (the wrapper thingy), "libtool" and "gperf"
# If you miss to install them, just restart the installation file and you can choose them.
# 
# It might be possible that you need to install MinGW first 
# and the cross-compiler in Cygwin ("mingw64-x86_64-gcc-...") after that.
# 
# Install MinGW http://www.mingw.org
# Note: Do not install MinGW in any location with spaces in the path name!
# The preferred installation target directory is C:\MinGW
# 
# Yices2 needs the static and dynamic version of GMP 
# and Windows doesn't allow both to be installed in the same dir, so we need to install it twice.
# 
# Building GMP(shared) 64:
# 
#     Download GMP https://gmplib.org/
#     Switch to Cygwin
# 
#     Unzip/Untar your GMP download to a location ${gmp_build} with for example:
#     cd ${gmp_build}
#     tar -xf ${gmp_download}/gmp-x.x.x.tar.gz //for a tar.xz ball
# 
#     cd into/new/gmp/dir
#     We need to set mingw64 as compiler. 
#     CC NM and AR need to match your installed mingw (located at /usr/bin ).
#     The --prefix is the install location. You can change it, but remember where you put it.
# 
#     ./configure --disable-static --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/tools/shared-gmp \
#     --host=x86_64-pc-mingw32 --build=i686-pc-cygwin CC=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
#     NM=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-nm AR=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar CC_FOR_BUILD=gcc
#
#     make
#     make check
#     make install
# 
#     That should have "installed" the following files that we need:
# 
#     /usr/tools/static-gmp/bin/libgmp-10.dll (DLL)
#     /usr/tools/static-gmp/lib/libgmp.dll.a (import library)
#     /usr/tools/static-gmp/lib/libgmp.la (stuff used by libtool)
#     /usr/tools/static-gmp/include/gmp.h
# 
# Building GMP (static) 32:
# 
#     Go back to the dir you Unzipped the tarball (same as shared)
# 
#     The following installs the static GMP to /tools/static_gmp but you can change that of course:
#     You need to use "make clean" after a failed make or it might not configure correctly!
#
#     ./configure --disable-shared --enable-static --prefix=/usr/tools/static-gmp \
#     --host=x86_64-pc-mingw32 --build=i686-pc-cygwin CC=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
#     NM=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-nm AR=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar CC_FOR_BUILD=gcc
#
#     make
#     make check
#     make install
# 
#     This should have installed:
# 
#     /usr/tools/static-gmp/lib/libgmp.a
#     /usr/tools/static-gmp/include/gmp.h
# 
# 
# Now we build Yices2 (The Yices2 documentation gives 2 options to configure yices2 here. I used the second.)
#     You may need to edit the compiler etc. just like in step 5 + specify where you have installed your GMP
#     (CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS point to the shared GMP. with-static-gmp, with-static-gmp-include-dir point to the static GMP.
#      On Windows a static GMP is also PIC per default.)
#     After using configure you need to give 'OPTION=mingw64' to every make command. 
#     (including make clean)
#     adding "static-dist" linkds gmp statically into yices. This means that binaries etc. are in the build folders static_bin/ and no longer in bin/ in yices2.
# 
#     ./configure --build=x86_64-pc-mingw32 CC=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
#     LD=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ld STRIP=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-strip \
#     RANLIB=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ranlib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/tools/shared-gmp/include \
#     LDFLAGS=-L/usr/tools/shared-gmp/lib --with-static-gmp=/usr/tools/static-gmp/lib/libgmp.a \
#     --with-static-gmp-include-dir=/usr/tools/static-gmp/include --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32
# 
#     make static-dist OPTION=mingw64
# 
# Build the JNI wrapper dll:
#     To build yices2 bindings: ./compileForWindows.sh $YICES_SRC_DIR $SHARED_GMP_SRC_DIR $STATIC_GMP_SRC_DIR $JNI_DIR
#
#  Note: You must change the line/file endings of this script on your Windows
#        environment to Unix style so that you can run it in Cygwin
#     
#     After running the script, copy the libyices.dll from the Yices2 folder 
#     (yices2/build/x86_64-unknown-mingw32-release/bin) and the libyices2j.dll 
#     to java-smt\lib\native\x86_64-windows and/or publish it.
