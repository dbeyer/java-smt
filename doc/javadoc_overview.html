<body>
<p>JavaSMT is a generic API allowing unified access to different SMT solvers.</p>

<p>All the interaction with a solver is performed through the
{@link org.sosy_lab.java_smt.api.SolverContext} interface, which encapsulates a
single context.
{@link org.sosy_lab.java_smt.api.SolverContext} instances are created using
{@link org.sosy_lab.java_smt.SolverContextFactory}.</p>
